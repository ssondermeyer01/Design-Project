<p>Hey guys! If you're anything like me, you must constantly expect the worst of any situation.
That's nothing to be ashamed of! One of my favourite expressions in French is "mieux vaut prévenir
que guérir" which translates to it's more valuable to prevent than to cure. In other words, it's
easier to prepare before something problematic occurs than to treat the affected.</p><br>
 
<p>Everyone interprets things differently but I think this expression is literary proof about allegations
that the "apocalyptic-preparers" have discussed. Therefore, this might be a bit of a rocky transition
but in this article, I'm going to give some pointers about what you should have in an emergency preparedness bag, apocalyptically related or not.</p><br>
 
<p>**Note: I only have an 8-hour class certification from the Canadian Red Cross. I am not a professional
government agency that specializes in trying to save humanity if the world was to go kaput. My articles
are based on the knowledge that I have acquired and not methods used by the Government of Canada. I'd also
like for all readers to note that I am not responsible for any consequences of my advice put into action
by aspirants with no experience. Okay, that's all, enjoy!</p><br>
 
<p>The following list contains the top 5 items to include in your emergency preparedness bag. If you scroll
to the bottom of the page, I have included a link to kits already assembled by the Canadian Red Cross, but homemade kits work just as well.</p><br>
 
<p>**Note: I'd like to clarify that the Canadian Red Cross does not sponsor "THE APOCALYPSE" but that their
products happen to be those that I have the most experience with due to coincidental coincidences. On that note,
let's get started!</p><br>
<br>
<!--List-->
<ol>
<li>First Aid Kit &#8594; You should <u><b>ALWAYS</b></u> have a first aid kit with you at all times.
It can save your life or someone else's if used properly! <a href="https://products.redcross.ca/category/197/family-and-community-kits">
Here</a> are many Canadian Red Cross first aid kits that I recommend (but the deluxe is best...)</li>
<li>Flashlight/Radio &#8594; This will supply a light source that will allow you to see in the dark.
    Certain flashlights also come with a radio which allows you to listen in to the latest news and instructions
    during an emergency.</li>
<li>10 L Water Container &#8594; This oversized bottle will allow you to store a large amount of water 
in case there is a drought.</li>
<li>Emergency Food Rations &#8594; Usually, this comes in a brick of calories that will last you a week.
Hopefully, that will give you enough time to get organized, read up on different tree roots you can eat
and eventually, learn to hunt.</li>
<li>Water Purification Tablets &#8594; These will allow you to purify your water so that it is potable and safe to drink.</li>

<p>Again, these are only the basics so feel free to add more elements to your bag. Remember: it's better
to pack too much rather than too little. Anyways, that's all folks! I hope you feel more prepared!</p><br>
